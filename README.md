![hello](https://img.shields.io/badge/hello,-8A2BE2?style=for-the-badge)

I’m a Software Engineer who builds high-performance, reliable web products end-to-end, owning feature slices from the UI through backend services and the systems behind them. I’m metrics-driven and pragmatic: measure, ship, iterate, and keep complexity on a leash. Likewise, I like using Domain-Driven Design to keep boundaries sharp and align engineering with the business, especially in event-driven systems. I care a lot about developer experience and scalability, so I invest in tooling, observability, and clear working models (plus the docs and mentoring to make them stick).

Personality-wise, I’m direct, calm under pressure, and focused on outcomes, fast delivery without sacrificing quality.
